You can provide a closure to the pickerController, which is going to be invoked when the user is changing a color. Notice that you will receive intermediate color changes. You can use these by coloring the object the User is actually trying to color, so she/he gets a direct visual feedback on how a color changes the appearance of an object of interet. The ColorWell aids in this process by showing old and new color side-by-side.
